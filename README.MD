# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up

1. Download the repo using `git clone https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI.git` in your terminal or directly from github page in zip format and unzip in your desired folder
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository `cd SuperAGI`

# üõ† Configuration

1. Find the file named .env.template in the main SuperAGI folder. This file may be hidden by default in some operating systems due to the dot prefix. To reveal hidden files, follow the instructions for your specific operating system: [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5), [macOS](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-access-your-macs-hidden-files).
2. Create a copy of .env.template and call it .env; if you're already in a command prompt/terminal window: cp .env.template .env.
Open the .env file in a text editor.
3. Find the line that says OPENAI_API_KEY=.
4. After the =, enter your unique OpenAI API Key without any quotes or spaces.
5. Enter any other API keys or tokens for services you would like to use.
6. Save and close the .env file

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running SuperAGI
Simply run the startup script in your terminal. This will install any necessary Python packages and launch SuperAGI

* On Linux/MacOS:
`./run.sh`
* On Windows:
`.\run.bat`
> If this gives errors, make sure you have a compatible Python version installed.
