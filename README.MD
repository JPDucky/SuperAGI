# üõ£ Roadmap
[Click here to checkout the latest roadmap üîó](https://github.com/users/TransformerOptimus/projects/1)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up

1. Download the repo using `git clone https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI.git` in your terminal or directly from github page in zip format and unzip in your desired folder
2. Navigate to the directory using `cd SuperAGI`

# Setting up Virtual Environment:
- Creating a Virtual Environment:

Before starting with the project, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment in Python. This isolates the packages required for the project from other packages installed on your system, avoiding potential compatibility issues.

  To create a virtual environment, follow the steps below for your respective operating system:

  - For Linux and Mac:
    1. Open a terminal window.
    2. Install the `virtualenv` package, if not already installed, by running: `pip install virtualenv` or `pip3 install virtualenv`.
    3. Navigate to your project directory using `cd` command.
    4. Create a virtual environment by running: `virtualenv venv` (you can replace "venv" with your desired virtual environment name).
    5. Activate the virtual environment by running: `source venv/bin/activate`.

  - For Windows:
    1. Open a command prompt window.
    2. Install the `virtualenv` package, if not already installed, by running: `pip install virtualenv`.
    3. Navigate to your project directory using `cd` command.
    4. Create a virtual environment by running: `virtualenv venv` (you can replace "venv" with your desired virtual environment name).
    5. Activate the virtual environment by running: `venv\Scripts\activate`.

# üõ† Configuration

1. Create a virtualenv in the project directory as mentioned above.
2. Find the file named config_template.yaml in the main SuperAGI folder.
3. Create a copy of config_template.yaml and name it config.yaml; if you're already in a command terminal window: cp config_template.yaml  config.yaml.
4. Open the config.yaml file in a text editor.
5. Find the line that says OPENAI_API_KEY:
6. After the `:` in the respective variable assignment, enter your unique OpenAI API Key, Google key, Custom search engine ID, and Pinecone API key without any quotes or spaces. You can obtain these keys by signing up for developer accounts at the respective service providers. Follow the links below to get your keys:

- OpenAI API Key: Sign up and create an API key at [OpenAI Developer](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
- Google key: Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the API you need (for example: Google Custom Search JSON API). Then, create an API key in the "Credentials" section.
- Custom search engine ID: Visit [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) to create a custom search engine for your application and obtain the search engine ID.
- Pinecone API key: Sign up at [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) and create an API key in your account dashboard.
  * If you're on the Pinecone free plan, you only have 1 pod and 1 index available.  As a workaround, change the index name used in test.py where `memory` is defined: `memory = VectorFactory.get_vector_storage("PineCone", "my-current-indexname", OpenAiEmbedding())`
7. Save and close the config.yaml file

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running SuperAGI
Simply run the start script in your terminal. This will install any necessary Python packages and launch SuperAGI

* On Linux/MacOS:
`. run.sh`
* On Windows:
`.\run.bat`
> If this gives errors, make sure you have a compatible Python version installed (preferrably python 3.10).

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Development!
